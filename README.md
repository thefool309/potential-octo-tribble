### A few things I did before starting college to learn to write code.

currently I have uploaded a simple nested for loop exercise in a C++ file called "pyramid.cpp".

num_guess_while_loop.cpp taught me while loops and was kind of my first nested loop

the-contract.cpp helped me figure out if statements and contains my first for loop.

I have uploaded NPyC and NPC++, two versions of a DND 5e character generator I'm working on. These are built in Python and C++ respectively. These are all AS IS software and will not be updated. Please check my other repos for more updated versions.

I have uploaded an excercise in which I learned to define and call functions: definiing_and_calling_function.cpp.
