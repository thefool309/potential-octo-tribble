currently I have uploaded a simple nested for loop exercise to a C++ file called "pyramid.cpp".

num_guess_while_loop taught me while loops and was technically my first nested loop

the-contract helped me figure out if statemonts and contains my first for loop.

I have uploaded NPC and NPC++, two versions of a DND 5e character generator I'm working on. These are built in Python and C++ respectively.
as I update them elsewhere I will update them here as well.

to be continued...
